That project involved some really innovative technology, and we’re currently exploring options for protecting and potentially commercializing the core ideas. It’s a very exciting area, and we’re actively looking into intellectual property protection. \\n\\nI’m really focused on continuing to learn and develop, and securing a patent would be a fantastic next step. \\n\\nWould you like to know more about the Appcon project?'"
